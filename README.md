# üß† Embedding Analysis Search

A **FastAPI-powered** semantic search engine using **SBERT embeddings** to find the most relevant news articles based on natural language queries. The frontend is built with **React.js** for an intuitive search experience. Also contains, analysis and comparisons on different embeddings methods. Helped me understand the differences between `TF-IDF`, `Sentence-BERT` and `word2vec (CBOW & Skip-gram)`. 

## üöÄ Features
- **FastAPI backend** with semantic search using **Sentence-BERT (SBERT)**
- **React frontend** with smooth UI/UX and real-time search results
- **CORS-enabled** API for seamless communication between front and back
- **Clean animations & modern UI** for an enhanced user experience
